Hypertension Prediction Project 🩺
 
OBJECTIVE 🎯
The primary goal of this project is to develop and deploy a user-friendly machine learning web application that predicts an individual's likelihood of having hypertension based on key health metrics.

💡 How it Works
Enter your health stats in the web form.

The app sends your data to a Python backend.

The backend uses a trained machine learning model (hypertention.pkl) to make a prediction.

You get an instant result: "High risk" or "Low risk."
